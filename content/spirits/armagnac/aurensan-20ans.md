8/10. Exceptional. I have to try the 30-year!

## Background
---
Located in Armagnac-T√©nar√®ze, Domaine D'Aurensan has been managed by the Rozes for over 120 years. Currently, sisters Caroline and Sophie along with their father, Bernard, run the daily operations here including planting, harvesting, vinification, distilling, cellaring, and bottling...the whole shebang. The vineyard is approximately 7 hectares and comprised of Ugni Blanc, Colombard, Folle Blanche, and 'ghost' variety Plant
de graisse. Distillation is conducted on a continuous still and the cellars are considered humid. Interestingly, the casks are made from oak trees felled on the estate. Aside from being a stunning example of armagnac from T√©nar√®ze, I love that the domain is owned/ran by women and that Auresan bottles their expressions without added coloring, sugar, filtration, or reduction via water. 

This expression was bottled in July 2021 and is an "assemblage" of four single barrels (1977, 1990, 1996, and 2000) all from Ugni Blanc eau-de-vie. This bottle is from Lot #14, a 390L batch with 43.3% abv.

## Review

### Nose :nose:
Wow. Cocoa nibs, fig, plum, cherry, apricot, vanilla, caramel, sugar syrup, orange peel. 
Couldn't ask for much more. 

### Taste :tongue:
Excellent, full mouthfeel with loads of chocolate, vanilla, and dried fig. The finish is long and the alcohol content provides a suitable warmth that is neither too harsh or too "watery" tasting. The aftertaste is grape and vanilla with minor hints of smoke. No astringency is present. 

### Overall :clipboard:
8/10. Unlikely to be beat by another T√©nar√®ze unless it's their own 30 year or vintage expression.
