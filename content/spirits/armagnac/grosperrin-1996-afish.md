8/10. An excellent, very unique armagnac with layers of flavor.

## Background
---
Grosperrin is a cognac n√©gociant that has sourced expressions from over 150 wine-makers across every growing area (cru) of the Cognac appellation since about 1999. Occasionally it seems Grosperrin dabbles in armagnac and [Aficionados Group](https://aficionadosgroup.com/) fortunately snagged a cask back in early 2020. 
 
The vineyard/distiller of this particular bottling was never disclosed but we do know that it was sourced from a small farm near the village of Courrensan in Bas-Armagnac region, distilled on a traveling, continuous copper alembic still, and stored in a cellar holding only 20-30 casks at a time. This expression was selected from a single cask at 53.1% with a 1996 vintage. Purchased for about $90 (+ international shipping) via [FineDrams](https://www.finedrams.com/) but sold out now :sob:. 


## Review

### Nose :nose:
Incredibly layered, complex. Dark chocolate covered almonds, fig, black cherry, plum, ripe berries, orange peel, nutmeg, etc., etc. The nose here is the most unique of the armagnacs I've tasted to date. I've seen others mention an overwhelming presence of sulfur here and I suppose taken as a whole one could make that argument. If you sit and study for a bit a ton of different smells come out - try letting this rest for 10 minutes or so. 

### Taste :tongue:
Wonderfully rich with an excellent balance of alcohol and flavor. Grape, plum, strawberry are the primary fruits with hints of dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and walnut. Long finish with ample warmth and a mildly astringent aftertaste. 

### Overall :clipboard:
8/10. An excellent armagnac expression by cognac house Grosperrin. The Aficionados fellas sure can pick 'em. Now to track down some of these [cognacs](https://cognac-grosperrin.com/en/collection/our-collection/)...
