6/10. Very good. I'm excited to try some of their older expressions!

## Background
---
Domaine d'Esp√©rance is a relatively young domain (1990) located in Bas-Armagnac and ran by Jean-Louis and Claire de Montesquiou. The vineyards on the property extend about 45 hectares and nearly half of this is used in the cultivation of Baco and Folle Blanche grapes for distillation. Distillation is conducted on a continuous traditional still directly after fermentation. The eau-de-vie is then transferred into a new cask and then after an unspecified period of time into a used cask, both being made of Gascon oak. Like other domains I feature here, Esperance releases unadulterated brandy - no artificial coloring or added sugars and vintage expressions generally bottled cask strength. 

This bottle comes to me from [PM Spirits](https://www.pmspirits.com/) via NASA Liquor in Houston, Texas. The label suggests the grape is 100% Baco and that 480 bottles were taken from cask #176 at a cask strength of 48%.  


## Review

### Nose :nose:
Cocoa nibs, loads of vanilla, honey, orange peel, biscuit cookies, and green apple. 

### Taste :tongue:
Complex and rich. Dried fig, grape, chocolate, tobacco, black pepper, caramel, and a hint of vanilla. Finish is long, pleasantly warm, and briefly astringent. The aftertaste is a bit dry and resonates a slightly medicinal grape flavor.  

### Overall :clipboard:
6/10. I greatly enjoy the presence of cocoa throughout this expression (chocolate is the key to my heart after all...) but wasn't particularly fond of the aftertaste. A bit of water easily takes care of this though. I'd love to try some of the older bottlings out there to see if a bit more time in oak takes care of this. 16 years is fairly young for an armaganac after all...
