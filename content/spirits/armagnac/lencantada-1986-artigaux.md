5/10. Fine, but many other Encantada expressions I enjoy more.

## Background
---
I think I've provided enough background on L'Encantada [here](https://www.joshmclark.com/spirits/armagnac/lencantada-1974-bellair.html) so I'll be brief and only discuss the domain...or will I? Actually, little is known about Artigaux. L'Encantada doesn't list it among their primary domains and there isn't really any research or reviews out there. This is a relatively new domain for L'Encantada so hopefully we'll see more info soon. In the meantime, I've pinged some people with knowledge much beyond my own to see if they have any clue. I'll update this space if I learn more. 

Anyway, I purchased this bottle for the birth year vintage (1986) and opportunity to try a new domain. Cost was $117 (+ international shipping) via [FineDrams](https://www.finedrams.com/). Selected from cask #16 at 44.1% in June 2021. Oh, I guess the one thing we do know about the distiller is that they stored the casks in humid cellars. :thumbs_up: 

## Review

### Nose :nose:
Honey roasted figs, dried apricots, oakwood, vanilla, smoke, and sherry comprise a heavy rancio nose. :ok_hand: 

### Taste :tongue:
Viscous mouthfeel with a long, warm, and moderately astringent aftertaste. The primary flavors are leather, vanilla, fig, and walnut while the aftertaste briefly morphs into something a bit rubbery and similar to black liquorice. It's not unpleasant, rather it reminds me of a little of rum. :man_shrugging:

### Overall :clipboard:
5/10. I like it, just maybe not more than I would any of the dozen or so other L'Encantada domains currently out there. The nose was wonderful, but I wasn't particularly fond of the finish. Again, it's not a deal-breaker, just not my cup of armagnac. For someone else, this could easily be 7/10 rated.
