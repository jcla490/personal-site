## Background
---
Background on L'Encantada [here](https://www.joshmclark.com/spirits/armagnac/lencantada-1974-bellair.html). 

Anyway, I purchased this bottle for the birth year vintage (1986) and opportunity to try a new domain. Cost was $117 (+ international shipping) via [FineDrams](https://www.finedrams.com/). Selected from cask #16 at 44.1% in June 2021. Oh, I guess the one thing we do know about the distiller is that they stored the casks in humid cellars. :thumbs_up: 

## Review

### Nose :nose:
Honey roasted figs, dried apricots, oakwood, vanilla, smoke, and sherry comprise a heavy rancio nose. :ok_hand: 

### Taste :tongue:
Viscous mouthfeel with a long, warm, and moderately astringent aftertaste. The primary flavors are leather, vanilla, fig, and walnut while the aftertaste briefly morphs into something a bit rubbery and similar to black liquorice. It's not unpleasant, rather it reminds me of a little of rum. :man_shrugging:

### Overall :clipboard:
5/10. I like it, just maybe not more than I would any of the dozen or so other L'Encantada domains currently out there. The nose was wonderful, but I wasn't particularly fond of the finish. Again, it's not a deal-breaker, just not my cup of armagnac. For someone else, this could easily be 7/10 rated. 

### Jazz Pairing :trumpet:
