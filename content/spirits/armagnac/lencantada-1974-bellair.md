8/10. A wonderful, half-century old armagnac that is beautifully balanced.

## Background
---
Kicking off my reviews of the dozen or so orange wax adorned L'Encantada expressions I have is this 47 year old bottling from Domaine de Bellair. Although Lous Pibous and Le Fr√™che are arguably the more popular and accessible domains in the U.S. (perhaps due to their bourbon-esque profile), I was baited by a birth year 1986 Bellair from [FineDrams](https://www.finedrams.com/) a while back that I fell in love with and regrettably drank too fast. I'm lucky FineDrams has recently secured another wave of L'Encantada including this much older Bellair. My order shipped from Denmark and arrived in record time (10 days including holidays and weekends!) shortly after Christmas. Price was roughly $128 (+ international shipping). 

If you're not familiar with L'Encantada, it's time. Via esteemed importer [PM Spirits](https://www.pmspirits.com/), [L'Encantada](https://lencantada.fr/) has introduced high-quality armagnac in force to whiskey drinkers here in the U.S. over the last decade, and has even managed to convert a few of us to diehard grape fanatics. Sure, others like Darroze, Chateau de Laubade, and Delord have existed in the U.S. for longer, but none had really caught on with considerable success until L'Encantada. The label's appeal to bourbon drinkers, in my opinion, is their 'triple zero' philosophy: no reduction via water, no added sugar, and no added coloring. And while most other producers were cutting their armagnac to 40-42% and using the often confusing VS/VSOP/XO/Napoleon age statements, L'Encantada was dropping cask strength expressions carrying crazy vintage years (fun fact: this Bellair was distilled the year Nixon resigned!). This, of course, was attractive to bourbon enthusiasts who tend to associate higher age statements and proof with greater flavor and exclusivity. The bottle design was just icing on the cake: a wax seal and stamp, geeky labeling, and a wooden vintage tag were too irresistible.

So here we are in 2022. More and more whiskey clubs and U.S. stores are selecting their own L'Encantada casks and I couldn't be happier with the increase in availability. However, the downside is that prices have seen considerable increases as reviews - especially for Lous Pibous - have started to come in and stores are seeing greater demand. Good news is that select overseas stores like FineDrams usually have a vintage L'Encantada available if you're willing to pay the shipping. 

Anywayyyy, this 1974 Bellair. L'Encantada is a n√©gociant buying up armagnacs from small producers across the Armagnac region and Domaine de Bellair is one such estate located near the river Douze. Bellair grows Ugni Blanc and Baco grapes and is one of the few producers that maintains an onsite still (others generally rent time on a traveling still). The cellars at Bellair are considered humid, a characteristic known in brandy that generally yields lower proof and a more mellow, round spirit. This expression was taken from its cask (#12L) in June 2021 at 45.3%.

### Nose :nose:
Complex and layered with a lot of barrel influence. Dusty wood, tobacco, leather, rancio, vanilla, sweet caramel, toasted bread. 

### Taste :tongue:
Full, tannic mouthfeel with loads of grape and caramel along with more subtle flavors of vanilla, fig, walnut, and clove. The finish is a bit astringent at first but ultimately yields a lingering warmth and more oak notes that remind you of the incredible privilege it is to drink a spirit nearly half a century old for less than $150. Wild. 

### Overall :clipboard:
8/10. Delightful and of incredible value. I'd come back to this one again and again...
