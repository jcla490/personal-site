6/10. Not likely to 'wow' you but still great for a daily drinker.

## Background
---
Pasquet is a certified organic (since 1995) cognac house in the Grand Champagne region of France that distills from vineyards originally planted almost 300 years ago. The eau de vie for this particular bottling is made from Ugni Blanc grapes, although Folle Blance and Montils varieties have been replanted by the family in recent years. Pasquet uses a double distillation and ages in oak barrels sourced from forests in Limousin. Finally, barrels are stored in dry cellars with a slow reduction and no sugar added. 

Through the Grapevine is a limited cognac label with offerings sourced by the famous La Maison du Whisky of Paris. This bottling was selected from a single cask at 51.6% with a 1995 vintage. Purchased for about $165.


## Review

### Nose :nose:
Bright lemon and vanilla, black pepper, apple pie. Unoffensive and unintrusive.  

### Taste :tongue:
Full mouthfeel of lemon zest, pepper, and vanilla. Moderate finish with a generally pleasant aftertaste and warmth.

### Overall :clipboard:
6/10. Although this cognac is enjoyable in every sense, it's a bit one dimensional, carrying the same notes from the nose to the palate and into the finish. I had hoped the proof would have yielded something with more discernible complexity. Still, you could drink this every day with great satisfaction
