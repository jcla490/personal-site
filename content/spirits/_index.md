## Score Methodology

I use [Jay West](https://whiskeyraiders.com/about-t8ke/)'s scale to review spirits because he's a nice guy doing a lot for spirits lovers in the U.S. (especially bourbon and armagnac) and has reviewed well over 2,000 expressions. Surely his scale is battle-tested much beyond anything I could come up with!

| Score | Text Score | Description                       |
| ----- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1     | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out            |
| 2     | Poor       | I wouldn't consume by choice      |
| 3     | Bad        | Multiple flaws                    |
| 4     | Sub-par    | Not bad, but lots I'd rather have |
| 5     | Good       | Good, just fine                   |
| 6     | Very Good  | A cut above                       |
| 7     | Great      | Well above average                |
| 8     | Excellent  | Really quite exceptional          |
| 9     | Incredible | An all time favorite              |
| 10    | Perfect    | Perfect                           |

I tend to round down instead of up and try to be extremely judicious with handing out ratings above a 6.
