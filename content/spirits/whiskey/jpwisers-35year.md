5/10. Not flawed, just so many other things I'd rather have.

## Background
---
First Canadian whiskey alert ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. JP Wiser's 35 year is the pinnacle of the Canadian [Northern Borders Collection](https://canadianwhisky.org/blog/news-views/northern-border-collection-rare-releases-2017.html) which was first introduced in 2017. A great collection of reviews on this series can be found at [whiskyanalysis.com](https://whiskyanalysis.com/index.php/tag/northern-border-collection/). I am unsure if this collection of rare releases was meant to rival Buffalo Trace's Antique Collection or perhaps Corby/Hiram Walker is just taking a page out of the master's playbook. Either way, master blender Don Livermore has created some great expressions in this range and I've been fortunate to have tried all of the 2017 and 2018 releases. 

The 2018 release of JP Wiser's 35 Year is a blend of about 90% corn whiskey aged in reused ex-bourbon barrels with the rest being rye whiskey aged in virgin oak barrels. The rye portion is a much younger 'flavoring' whiskey added to the mix and was comprised of both column and pot-distilled whiskies. This was bottled at 50% like the 2017 release - a welcome sight considering that so many Canadian whiskies have been bottled at 40%. Purchased in Vancouver for $200 CAD.

### Nose :nose:
Creamy vanilla, honey, root beer, peach, orange peel, caramel, black pepper, rye spice, freshly baked bread. Wonderful and without any alcohol burn.  

### Taste :tongue:
Very rich, gobs of melted caramels, vanilla, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, black tea, cinnamon, and a bit of citrus. Finish is moderate and pleasant with an ample warmth that resonants vanilla and orange. Slightly astringent aftertaste.   

### Overall :clipboard:
7/10. A great whiskey that I would have loved to try at cask strength. That said, it's at an approachable proof with tons of flavor and a great nose. The only demerits to speak of are regarding the aftertaste, the barrel influence might be just a bit too strong for my liking.
