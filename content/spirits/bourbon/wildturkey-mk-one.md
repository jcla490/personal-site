## Background
---
Wild Turkey is, well, Wild Turkey...any background I could provide would pale in comparison to the comprehensive body of work by David Jennings found over at [rarebird101.com](https://rarebird101.com/). Also, his book regarding the distillery, *[American Spirit](https://mascotbooks.com/mascot-marketplace/buy-books/nonfiction/coffee-table/american-spirit-wild-turkey-bourbon-from-ripy-to-russell/)*, is essentially an encyclopedia of all things Wild Turkey, check it out!

Master's Keep is an annual series of 'rare' whiskies released by the distillery that are generally priced in the 'super premium' category (north of $120, arguably). 'One' comes in as one of the most expensive Master's Keep releases to date with a $175 price tag. This expression was blended from 9 to 14 year old bourbons and then left to age for an additional bit of time in a second round of new oak barrels (toasted and charred) that were placed in the Tyrone G rickhouse before finally being bottled at 101 proof. 

Double barrel finishes are all the rage right now among bourbon bros and maybe for good reason - Heaven Hill's 2019-2021 flight of Parker's Heavy Char releases were fantastic and Brown-Forman's Old Forester 1910 is about the only modern release of theirs I can stand. Craft distillers have found what I believe is the best way to mask youthfulness in their whiskies - another round in a new barrel quickly imparts a lot of flavor that we tend to associate with higher aged whiskies. Anyway, let's see how this one checks out.

## Review

### Nose :nose:
The oak influence is pronounced, caramel and vanilla lead the way along with notes of 
butterscotch, toffee, honey, and green tea. 

### Taste :tongue:
Creamy vanilla, toffee, and butterscotch continue here and are accompanied by baking spices, particularly clove and nutmeg, marshmallow, and tobacco. The mouthfeel is full-bodied while the finish is long and full of vanilla. The hug is subtle likely due to proof.

### Overall :clipboard:
5/10. At this price point it is important to me to consider value. Granted, I drop $200-300 on armagnacs like it's my job :tipping_hand_man:, but then we're talking 25-40 years of aging with no economy of scale (farm cellars containing maybe 50 or less casks). For a bourbon priced at $175, I expect gold and well, this is more like copper. It's not bad, I just don't believe it should be priced this high, especially since Wild Turkey has also released a 17-year bourbon around this price point. 

Taken without consideration of the price, it's a fine whiskey but not something particularly exciting. I say this with a heavy heart because I've had many great Wild Turkey offerings and often consider their standard expressions as daily drinkers.
