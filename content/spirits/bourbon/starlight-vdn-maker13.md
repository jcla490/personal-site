5/10. Not flawed, just so many other things I'd rather have.

## Background
---
Starlight is a young craft distillery located in southern Indiana at the wonderful  [Huber's Orchard and Winery](https://www.huberwinery.com/). Only about thirty minutes away from where I grew up in Louisville, I've been lucky to visit Huber's during many class field trips, family outings, and even had an incredible Thanksgiving meal here some twenty years ago! Starlight produces several whiskies, brandies, rum, and the usual clear spirits; as of this writing, most of the bourbon produced here is about 4-5 years of age while the rye is 5-6 years old. 

This particular selection was done by Jeffersonville, Indiana makerspace [Maker13](https://www.maker13.com/) and gifted to me by my great friend David B. The label shows a 4.5 year age statement with the whiskey taken from barrel FB139-1 at 52.7%. The finish is a Spanish Vino de Naranja (VDN, translates to orange wine) barrel where the bourbon was aged for an additional 3-8 months.  

## Review

### Nose :nose:
Primarily freshly popped popcorn, rye spice, vanilla, and a hint of orange zest. The corny youthfulness that is typically of this age is present but it's not unpleasant. 

### Taste :tongue:
The orange is more apparent here along with corn, vanilla and some heat. Mouthfeel was surprisingly rich. The finish is moderate length with an ample hug and unoffensive aftertaste of citrus and vanilla. 

### Overall :clipboard:
5/10. There is nothing particularly wrong with this bottle and I believe the finish works to help mask the more youthful notes. However, if I'm going to drink a bottle at this age from a craft producer, I am likely to opt for New Riff or Wildnerness Trail, both of which produce great bourbon/rye without finishing.
