## Background
---
Inspired after recently tasting [Maverick's 60% dark milk bar](https://maverickchocolate.com/products/60-dark-milk-chocolate), I decided to create my own. Interestingly, Maverick doesn't disclose the bean source for their bar and offers no tasting notes on the packaging. Perhaps they are using a blend of origins, or what is available/cheapest...who knows :man_shrugging:. Whole vanilla bean makes an appearance in the ingredients list which I believe is used to sweeten the bar enough to dull the typical bitterness some folks hate about dark chocolate. This makes the bar an excellent gateway for someone looking to experiment with higher cocoa percentages but generally has the side effect of muting the unique cacao flavors of the underlying bean. This of course is contradictory to purist chocolate maker who, like the barista, seeks to showcase the bean and its flavors. 

I've not made much milk chocolate as I've preferred to focus on single origin dark chocolates (65-80%) to learn which beans I prefer to work with (and eat). Also, it's scary...milk chocolate adds a whole other ingredient that tends to alter certain aspects of the process. During refining, I've noted that the melanger runs 15-25F hotter than normal and of course the mixture is much more creamy adding additional resistance to the motor - both issues that could result in earlier maintenance needs. During the conching phase, it is more difficult to discern the presence of acetic acid due to the milk flavors and generally increased sugar content. It is possible that after the bar develops in the days following moulding it could turn into an acidic beast. Lastly, it can be difficult to pin down the appropriate amount of milk content; go too high and you risk imparting flavors of sour cream to your bar. Too low and you're back to the bitterness you were trying to mitigate in the first place.  

Nonetheless, dark milk chocolates are becoming increasingly popular as more people are moving from store candy bars and gourmet chocolates into the craft chocolate world. I see the appeal of the bar surely - Maverick's is really enjoyable. Anyway, time to decide on an approach and see what shakes out. 

## Methodology
---
I once received a crazy awesome deal on some ten pounds of roasted India Anamalai nibs from Meridian Cacao (maybe $6/lb?). After trying and failing to produce a dark bar at 75% and then at 62% that wasn't a total acid bomb, I had mostly abandoned this bean and left the bag to sift to the bottom of the bean storage container. I thought maybe I could use it in the future for a low % milk bar or my experiments in whiskey/brandy finished cocoa but I think it will make a perfect bean for a dark milk bar. The intensity and acidity of this bean has so far been too much for me but sharing the stage among near equal or greater percentages of cocoa butter, sugar, and whole milk powder could result in a wonderful compromise: enough flavor remaining but with the intensity dialed back significantly. I considered selecting a more neutral bean here, one with round, traditional chocolate type flavor like maybe Ecuador Camino Verde or a Columbia origin but felt it would be overcome by milk flavors and I'm just really spooked about making something tasting like sour cream. 

Anyway, the final recipe is:

|                  | Source                | Certs                  | Percentage |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| **Bean**         | India Anamalai Estate | None                   | 32%        |
| **Cocoa Butter** | Dominican Republic    | Fair trade, organic    | 23%        |
| **Sugar**        | Brazil                | Fair for life, organic | 25%        |
| **Milk Powder**  | USA                   | organic                | 20%        |

The projected refining time is 24-36 hours to achieve consistent sub-20Œºm particle sizes and then an additional 12 hours minimum conch time. Tempering is done at 95F using 1% cocoa butter silk and bars are moulded at 92F, held constant by the world's most expensive warming device: the Mol d'Art dry heat melter. 


## Results

The total time in the refiner was about 36 hours with an additional 10 hours spent with the rollers disengaged for conching. The loss ratio (amount lost to water evaporation and/or residual left in the refiner) was 11% on the nose - one of my lowest yet. The batch ultimately yield 39 bars at roughly 53 grams each. 

I'm writing this two days after moulding and the bar has settled up quite well. The smell is sweet and carmel-like while the color is light and immediately indicative of a milk chocolate. The taste is creamy and rich, full of caramel and brief acidity most comparable to raspberry. The finish is a quick flash of milk with an aftertaste of mouth-coating caramel. It's an overall decadent bar that might even be too rich...I can't finish a whole bar in one sitting. 

Overall, I'm pleased with this bar and I feel the addition of milk really helped knock down the acidity in this bean. I am not so pleased with the feel of the bar however -  because of the high milk and cocoa butter content it really doesn't hold up to warm hands as well as a dark bar. I'm not too certain what could be done about that (if anything) but will keep it in mind if I decide to do another milk bar!
