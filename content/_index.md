Hi! I'm a senior engineer at [IndigoAg](https://www.indigoag.com/) working predominantly with remote sensing datasets and python. I love all things related to [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/), and making geospatial data more easily accessible/enjoyable for others (e.g. [STAC](https://stacspec.org/), [COGs](https://www.cogeo.org/)).

I also use this space to review [spirits](/spirits.html) (bourbon, armagnac, and cognac mainly) and write about my adventures in [chocolate making](/chocolate.html).
