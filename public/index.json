[{"content":"5/10. Not flawed, just so many other things I\u0026rsquo;d rather have.  Background   First Canadian whiskey alert 🇨🇦🇨🇦. JP Wiser\u0026rsquo;s 35 year is the pinnacle of the Canadian Northern Borders Collection which was first introduced in 2017. A great collection of reviews on this series can be found at whiskyanalysis.com. I am unsure if this collection of rare releases was meant to rival Buffalo Trace\u0026rsquo;s Antique Collection or perhaps Corby/Hiram Walker is just taking a page out of the master\u0026rsquo;s playbook. Either way, master blender Don Livermore has created some great expressions in this range and I\u0026rsquo;ve been fortunate to have tried all of the 2017 and 2018 releases.\nThe 2018 release of JP Wiser\u0026rsquo;s 35 Year is a blend of about 90% corn whiskey aged in reused ex-bourbon barrels with the rest being rye whiskey aged in virgin oak barrels. The rye portion is a much younger \u0026lsquo;flavoring\u0026rsquo; whiskey added to the mix and was comprised of both column and pot-distilled whiskies. This was bottled at 50% like the 2017 release - a welcome sight considering that so many Canadian whiskies have been bottled at 40%. Purchased in Vancouver for $200 CAD.\nReview   Nose :nose:  Creamy vanilla, honey, root beer, peach, orange peel, caramel, black pepper, rye spice, freshly baked bread. Wonderful and without any alcohol burn.\nTaste :tongue:  Very rich, gobs of melted caramels, vanilla, crème brûlée, black tea, cinnamon, and a bit of citrus. Finish is moderate and pleasant with an ample warmth that resonants vanilla and orange. Slightly astringent aftertaste.\nOverall :clipboard:  7/10. A great whiskey that I would have loved to try at cask strength. That said, it\u0026rsquo;s at an approachable proof with tons of flavor and a great nose. The only demerits to speak of are regarding the aftertaste, the barrel influence might be just a bit too strong for my liking.\nJazz Pairing :trumpet:  ","date":"1 February 2022","permalink":"/spirits/whiskey/jpwisers-35year.html","section":"Spirits","summary":"5/10.

Background   Located in Armagnac-Ténarèze, Domaine D\u0026rsquo;Aurensan has been managed by the Rozes for over 120 years. Currently, sisters Caroline and Sophie along with their father, Bernard, run the daily operations here including planting, harvesting, vinification, distilling, cellaring, and bottling\u0026hellip;the whole shebang. The vineyard is approximately 7 hectares and comprised of Ugni Blanc, Colombard, Folle Blanche, and \u0026lsquo;ghost\u0026rsquo; variety Plant de graisse. Distillation is conducted on a continuous still and the cellars are considered humid. Interestingly, the casks are made from oak trees felled on the estate. Aside from being a stunning example of armagnac from Ténarèze, I love that the domain is owned/ran by women and that Auresan bottles their expressions without added coloring, sugar, filtration, or reduction via water.\nThis expression was bottled in July 2021 and is an \u0026ldquo;assemblage\u0026rdquo; of four single barrels (1977, 1990, 1996, and 2000) all from Ugni Blanc eau-de-vie.

Interestingly, Maverick doesn\u0026rsquo;t disclose the bean source for their bar and offers no tasting notes on the packaging. Perhaps they are using a blend of origins, or what is available/cheapest\u0026hellip;who knows :man_shrugging:. Whole vanilla bean makes an appearance in the ingredients list which I believe is used to sweeten the bar enough to dull the typical bitterness some folks hate about dark chocolate. This makes the bar an excellent gateway for someone looking to experiment with higher cocoa percentages but generally has the side effect of muting the unique cacao flavors of the underlying bean. This of course is contradictory to purist chocolate maker who, like the barista, seeks to showcase the bean and its flavors.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve not made much milk chocolate as I\u0026rsquo;ve preferred to focus on single origin dark chocolates (65-80%) to learn which beans I prefer to work with (and eat). Also, it\u0026rsquo;s scary\u0026hellip;milk chocolate adds a whole other ingredient that tends to alter certain aspects of the process. During refining, I\u0026rsquo;ve noted that the melanger runs 15-25F hotter than normal and of course the mixture is much more creamy adding additional resistance to the motor - both issues that could result in earlier maintenance needs. During the conching phase, it is more difficult to discern the presence of acetic acid due to the milk flavors and generally increased sugar content. It is possible that after the bar develops in the days following moulding it could turn into an acidic beast. Lastly, it can be difficult to pin down the appropriate amount of milk content; go too high and you risk imparting flavors of sour cream to your bar. Too low and you\u0026rsquo;re back to the bitterness you were trying to mitigate in the first place.\nNonetheless, dark milk chocolates are becoming increasingly popular as more people are moving from store candy bars and gourmet chocolates into the craft chocolate world. I see the appeal of the bar surely - Maverick\u0026rsquo;s is really enjoyable. Anyway, time to decide on an approach and see what shakes out.\nMethodology   I once received a crazy awesome deal on some ten pounds of roasted India Anamalai nibs from Meridian Cacao (maybe $6/lb?). After trying and failing to produce a dark bar at 75% and then at 62% that wasn\u0026rsquo;t a total acid bomb, I had mostly abandoned this bean and left the bag to sift to the bottom of the bean storage container. I thought maybe I could use it in the future for a low % milk bar or my experiments in whiskey/brandy finished cocoa but I think it will make a perfect bean for a dark milk bar. The intensity and acidity of this bean has so far been too much for me but sharing the stage among near equal or greater percentages of cocoa butter, sugar, and whole milk powder could result in a wonderful compromise: enough flavor remaining but with the intensity dialed back significantly. I considered selecting a more neutral bean here, one with round, traditional chocolate type flavor like maybe Ecuador Camino Verde or a Columbia origin but felt it would be overcome by milk flavors and I\u0026rsquo;m just really spooked about making something tasting like sour cream.\nAnyway, the final recipe is:\n    Source Certs Percentage     Bean India Anamalai Estate None 32%   Cocoa Butter Dominican Republic Fair trade, organic 23%   Sugar Brazil Fair for life, organic 25%   Milk Powder USA organic 20%    The projected refining time is 24-36 hours to achieve consistent sub-20μm particle sizes and then an additional 12 hours minimum conch time. Tempering is done at 95F using 1% cocoa butter silk and bars are moulded at 92F, held constant by the world\u0026rsquo;s most expensive warming device: the Mol d\u0026rsquo;Art dry heat melter.\nResults  The total time in the refiner was about 36 hours with an additional 10 hours spent with the rollers disengaged for conching. The loss ratio (amount lost to water evaporation and/or residual left in the refiner) was 11% on the nose - one of my lowest yet. The batch ultimately yield 39 bars at roughly 53 grams each.\nI\u0026rsquo;m writing this two days after moulding and the bar has settled up quite well. The smell is sweet and carmel-like while the color is light and immediately indicative of a milk chocolate. The taste is creamy and rich, full of caramel and brief acidity most comparable to raspberry. The finish is a quick flash of milk with an aftertaste of mouth-coating caramel. It\u0026rsquo;s an overall decadent bar that might even be too rich\u0026hellip;I can\u0026rsquo;t finish a whole bar in one sitting.\nOverall, I\u0026rsquo;m pleased with this bar and I feel the addition of milk really helped knock down the acidity in this bean. I am not so pleased with the feel of the bar however - because of the high milk and cocoa butter content it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold up to warm hands as well as a dark bar. I\u0026rsquo;m not too certain what could be done about that (if anything) but will keep it in mind if I decide to do another milk bar!\n","date":"23 January 2022","permalink":"/chocolate/india-55-darkmilk.html","section":"Chocolate making","summary":"Batch 2201-021  Background   Inspired after recently tasting Maverick\u0026rsquo;s 60% dark milk bar, I decided to create my own.","title":"Dark Milk | India Anamalai 55%"},{"content":"6/10. Very good. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to try some of their older expressions!  Background   Domaine d\u0026rsquo;Espérance is a relatively young domain (1990) located in Bas-Armagnac and ran by Jean-Louis and Claire de Montesquiou. The vineyards on the property extend about 45 hectares and nearly half of this is used in the cultivation of Baco and Folle Blanche grapes for distillation. Distillation is conducted on a continuous traditional still directly after fermentation. The eau-de-vie is then transferred into a new cask and then after an unspecified period of time into a used cask, both being made of Gascon oak. Like other domains I feature here, Esperance releases unadulterated brandy - no artificial coloring or added sugars and vintage expressions generally bottled cask strength.\nThis bottle comes to me from PM Spirits via NASA Liquor in Houston, Texas. The label suggests the grape is 100% Baco and that 480 bottles were taken from cask #176 at a cask strength of 48%.\nReview   Nose :nose:  Cocoa nibs, loads of vanilla, honey, orange peel, biscuit cookies, and green apple.\nTaste :tongue:  Complex and rich.

I greatly enjoy the presence of cocoa throughout this expression (chocolate is the key to my heart after all\u0026hellip;) but wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly fond of the aftertaste. A bit of water easily takes care of this though.

Actually, little is known about Artigaux. L\u0026rsquo;Encantada doesn\u0026rsquo;t list it among their primary domains and there isn\u0026rsquo;t really any research or reviews out there. This is a relatively new domain for L\u0026rsquo;Encantada so hopefully we\u0026rsquo;ll see more info soon.

Background   Kicking off my reviews of the dozen or so orange wax adorned L\u0026rsquo;Encantada expressions I have is this 47 year old bottling from Domaine de Bellair. Although Lous Pibous and Le Frêche are arguably the more popular and accessible domains in the U.S. (perhaps due to their bourbon-esque profile), I was baited by a birth year 1986 Bellair from FineDrams a while back that I fell in love with and regrettably drank too fast. I\u0026rsquo;m lucky FineDrams has recently secured another wave of L\u0026rsquo;Encantada including this much older Bellair. My order shipped from Denmark and arrived in record time (10 days including holidays and weekends!) shortly after Christmas. Price was roughly $128 (+ international shipping).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with L\u0026rsquo;Encantada, it\u0026rsquo;s time. Via esteemed importer PM Spirits, L\u0026rsquo;Encantada has introduced high-quality armagnac in force to whiskey drinkers here in the U.S. over the last decade, and has even managed to convert a few of us to diehard grape fanatics. Sure, others like Darroze, Chateau de Laubade, and Delord have existed in the U.S. for longer, but none had really caught on with considerable success until L\u0026rsquo;Encantada. The label\u0026rsquo;s appeal to bourbon drinkers, in my opinion, is their \u0026lsquo;triple zero\u0026rsquo; philosophy: no reduction via water, no added sugar, and no added coloring. And while most other producers were cutting their armagnac to 40-42% and using the often confusing VS/VSOP/XO/Napoleon age statements, L\u0026rsquo;Encantada was dropping cask strength expressions carrying crazy vintage years (fun fact: this Bellair was distilled the year Nixon resigned!). This, of course, was attractive to bourbon enthusiasts who tend to associate higher age statements and proof with greater flavor and exclusivity. The bottle design was just icing on the cake: a wax seal and stamp, geeky labeling, and a wooden vintage tag were too irresistible.\nSo here we are in 2022. More and more whiskey clubs and U.S. stores are selecting their own L\u0026rsquo;Encantada casks and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be happier with the increase in availability. However, the downside is that prices have seen considerable increases as reviews - especially for Lous Pibous - have started to come in and stores are seeing greater demand. Good news is that select overseas stores like FineDrams usually have a vintage L\u0026rsquo;Encantada available if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to pay the shipping.\nAnywayyyy, this 1974 Bellair. L\u0026rsquo;Encantada is a négociant buying up armagnacs from small producers across the Armagnac region and Domaine de Bellair is one such estate located near the river Douze. Bellair grows Ugni Blanc and Baco grapes and is one of the few producers that maintains an onsite still (others generally rent time on a traveling still). The cellars at Bellair are considered humid, a characteristic known in brandy that generally yields lower proof and a more mellow, round spirit. This expression was taken from its cask (#12L) in June 2021 at 45.3%.\nReview   Nose :nose:  Complex and layered with a lot of barrel influence. Dusty wood, tobacco, leather, rancio, vanilla, sweet caramel, toasted bread.\nTaste :tongue:  Full, tannic mouthfeel with loads of grape and caramel along with more subtle flavors of vanilla, fig, walnut, and clove. The finish is a bit astringent at first but ultimately yields a lingering warmth and more oak notes that remind you of the incredible privilege it is to drink a spirit nearly half a century old for less than $150.

The label shows a 4.5 year age statement with the whiskey taken from barrel FB139-1 at 52.7%.

There is nothing particularly wrong with this bottle and I believe the finish works to help mask the more youthful notes. However, if I\u0026rsquo;m going to drink a bottle at this age from a craft producer, I am likely to opt for New Riff or Wildnerness Trail, both of which produce great bourbon/rye without finishing.\nJazz Pairing :trumpet:  ","date":"16 January 2022","permalink":"/spirits/whiskey/starlight-vdn-maker13.html","section":"Spirits","summary":"5/10.

This expression was blended from 9 to 14 year old bourbons and then left to age for an additional bit of time in a second round of new oak barrels (toasted and charred) that were placed in the Tyrone G rickhouse before finally being bottled at 101 proof.\nDouble barrel finishes are all the rage right now among bourbon bros and maybe for good reason - Heaven Hill\u0026rsquo;s 2019-2021 flight of Parker\u0026rsquo;s Heavy Char releases were fantastic and Brown-Forman\u0026rsquo;s Old Forester 1910 is about the only modern release of theirs I can stand. Craft distillers have also caught on and are using this method to mask youthfulness in their whiskies - another round in a new barrel quickly imparts a lot of flavor that tends to be associated with higher aged whiskies.

The mouthfeel is full-bodied while the finish is long and full of vanilla. The hug is subtle likely due to proof.\nOverall :clipboard:  5/10. At this price point it is important to me to consider value. Granted, I drop $200-300 on armagnacs like it\u0026rsquo;s my job :tipping_hand_man:, but then we\u0026rsquo;re talking 25-40 years of aging with no economy of scale (farm cellars containing maybe 50 or less casks). For a bourbon priced at $175, I expect gold and well, this is more like copper. It\u0026rsquo;s not bad, I just don\u0026rsquo;t believe it should be priced this high, especially since Wild Turkey has also released a 17-year bourbon around this price point.\nTaken without consideration of the price, it\u0026rsquo;s a fine whiskey but not something particularly exciting. This is more of a showcase around the double barrelling, not really the whiskey.
